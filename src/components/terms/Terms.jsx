            These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement
            between you and CloudSafari Inc. (CloudSafaris Canada) that govern
            your right to use the websites, applications, and other offerings
            from CloudSafari Inc. (collectively, the “CloudSafaris Platform”).
            When used in these Terms, “CloudSafaris,” “we,” “us,” or “our”
            refers to CloudSafari Inc. with whom you are contracting.

            The CloudSafaris Platform offers an online venue that enables users
            (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services.
            Members who publish and offer services are “Tour Operators.” Members
            who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” CloudSafari Inc.
            offers accommodations (“Accommodations”), activities, excursions,
            events (“Experiences”), safaris (“Safaris”), and a variety of travel
            and other services (collectively, “Tour Operator Services,” and each
            Tour Operator Service offering, a “Listing”). You must register an
            account to access and use many features of the CloudSafaris
            Platform, and must keep your account information accurate. As the
            provider of the CloudSafaris Platform, CloudSafaris does not own,
            control, offer or manage any Listings, Tour Operator Services, or
            safari services. CloudSafaris is not a party to the contracts
            entered into directly between Tour Operators and Guests, nor is
            CloudSafaris a real-estate broker, or insurer. CloudSafaris is not
            acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as
            specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”).

            We maintain other policies that supplement these Terms like our
            Privacy Policy, which describes our collection and use of personal
            data, and our Booking Terms, which govern any payment services
            provided to Members by the CloudSafaris entity (collectively
            "CloudSafaris Payments"). If you are a Tour Operator, Guide, or
            Accommodation Tour Operator, you are responsible for understanding
            and complying with all laws, rules, regulations and contracts with
            third parties that apply to your Tour Operator Services.

          <H3>2. Searching, Booking and Cancellations on CloudSafaris.</H3>
          <Text>
            You can search for Safari Services by using criteria like the travel
            destination, accommodation type, travel dates, and number of guests.
            You can also use filters to refine your search results. Search
            results are based on their relevance to your search and other
            criteria. Relevance considers factors like price, availability,
            Reviews, customer service and cancellation history, popularity,
            previous trips and saved Listings, Tour Operator requirements (e.g.
            minimum age requirement), and more.
          </Text>
          <text>
            Our aim is to provide exactly the right travel arrangements to suit
            your requirements.
          </text>
          <text>
            When you book a safari service, you are agreeing to pay all charges
            for your booking including the Safari service price, applicable
            fees, CloudSafaris’ service fee, offline fees, taxes, and any other
            items identified during checkout (collectively, “Total Price”). You
            are also agreeing that CloudSafaris may charge the Payment Method
            (as defined in the Payment Terms) used to book the Safari Service in
            order to collect Damage Claim (as defined in Section 17) amounts.
          </text>
          <text>
            When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Tour
            Operator Services (a "Reservation") is formed directly between you,
            the Accommodation(s), Transportation Partners, and the Tour
            Operator. In addition to these Terms, you will be subject to, and
            responsible for complying with, all terms of the Reservation,
            including without limitation, the cancellation policy and any other
            rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the
            Listing or during checkout that apply to the Reservation.
          </text>
          <text>
            The deposit required to book your trip is shown on your quotation.
            The deposit will be 30% of the total trip price, excepting air
            travel and any permits which need to be paid for in full at time of
            booking as tickets will be issued immediately and are non-refundable
            (‘the Deposit’). Occasionally an additional deposit may be requested
            in order to secure a booking e.g., for peak departure periods (“The
            Additional Deposit”). The purpose of the Deposit, other than payment
            to Third Party Suppliers, is to cover costs, disbursements and
            service fee incurred by CloudSafaris and in the event of any
            cancellation as provided for herein the Deposit and any Additional
            Deposit will be forfeited by the Client.
          </text>
          <text>
            You must make all payments in full and on time. Failure to make a
            payment may result in the cancellation of your travel and the
            forfeiture of your Deposit and any Additional Deposit. In such a
            case this would be considered a cancellation by you and the
            cancellation terms and fees as described below would be in effect.
            We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone. In such case, a
            full refund would be provided, and we would have no further
            liability to you.
          </text>
          <text>
            Your final balance will be due in full three calendar months prior
            to departure. Trips booked within three months of travel require
            full payment at the time of booking.
          </text>
          <text>
            Payments can be made by bank transfer or by credit or debit card.
            While we do accept major credit cards including Visa, Mastercard and
            American Express, travelers must provide to us a click or signed
            authorization for every transaction for your trip. Your
            authorization is an agreement for us to charge your card and an
            acknowledgement and agreement to the Company Terms and Conditions
            and the Supplier Terms and Conditions including the cancellation
            terms. It is your responsibility to read and understand these rules,
            standards, policies, and requirements prior to booking a Listing. Be
            aware that some Tour Operators work with a Co-Tour Operators (other
            Operators) or as part of a team to provide their Tour Operator
            Services.
          </text>
          <text>
            It is important for you to check the details on the Confirmation
            Invoice as soon as you get it. In the event of any discrepancy
            please contact us immediately at hello@cloudsafaris.com.
            CloudSafaris will be responsible for making payments to Third Party
            Suppliers on confirmed bookings by you on your behalf and remitting
            the booking fee element to the Company.

          </h4>
          <text>
            An Accommodation Reservation is a limited license to enter, occupy,
            and use the Accommodation. The Accommodation staff retain the right
            to re-enter the Accommodation during your stay, to the extent: (i)
            it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the
            Accommodation, and (iii) consistent with applicable law. If you stay
            past checkout, the Accommodation has the right to make you leave in
            a manner consistent with applicable law, including by imposing
            reasonable overstay penalties. You may not exceed the maximum number
            of allowed Guests. Accommodation Reservations also extend to the
            hotels, lodges, camps, tented lodges and other housing.

            An Experience or other Tour Operator Service Reservation entitles
            you to participate in, attend, or use that Tour Operator Service.
            You are responsible for confirming that you, and anyone you invite,
            meet minimum age, proficiency, fitness, or other requirements. You
            are responsible for informing the Tour Operator of any medical or
            physical conditions, or other circumstances that may impact your
            ability to participate, attend, or use the Tour Operator Service.
            Except where expressly authorized, you may not allow any person to
            join a Tour Operator Service unless they are included as an
            additional guest during the booking process.

          <text>
            The Company will make every effort to assist you if you wish to
            alter your arrangements. Guests and Tour Operators are responsible
            for any booking modifications they agree to make via the
            CloudSafaris Platform or direct CloudSafaris customer service to
            make on their behalf ("Booking Modifications"). If it is possible to
            make the amendment, it will be subject to any fees charged by our
            suppliers, together with all communication charges or other expenses
            incurred by the Company as a result of the change.

            <strong>2.3.1 Travel Issues, and Refunds</strong>
          </h4>
          <text>
            In general, if as a Guest you cancel a Reservation, the amount
            refunded to you is determined by the cancellation policy (as
            determined by CloudSafaris and the Tour Operator) that applies to
            that Reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take
            precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If the Tour
            Operator cancels, or you experience a Travel Issue (as defined in
            our Guest Refund Policy), you may be eligible for rebooking
            assistance or a partial or full refund pending the circumstance as
            evaluated by CloudSafaris
          </text>
          <text>
            All cancellations are subject to the Supplier Terms and Conditions
            of the Third Party Suppliers. Some Third Party Suppliers may choose
            to offer future travel credits in lieu of a cash refund. We
            CloudSafaris are not liable for a Third Party Supplier’s failure to
            provide a refund or for Third Party Supplier insolvency or
            bankruptcy.
